#### Issues and Reporting Bugs

**Please search existing issues, before creating a new one;** every issue is labeled and attended carefully. If you open a duplicate issue, it will be closed immediately.

If you cannot find your issue/bug in a previous ticket, please include details such as your browser, any other 3rd party JavaScript libraries you are using, and ideally a code sample demonstrating the problem. (Try [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/nuqapopefo/1/edit?html,output))

#### Contributing

Feeling inspired? Please contribute! Optimizations, compatibility and bug fixes are greatly preferred over new features, but don’t be shy. One thing sorely missing from ScrollReveal right now is a test suite.
